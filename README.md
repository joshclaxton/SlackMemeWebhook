# SlackMemeWebhook

I built this as a joke/prank for a coworker who became the subject of numerous memes. Everyone was manually making the memes, but with this they could just tell Slack to generate it by supplying the picture and text as parameters.

Usage: /slackCommand emotion toptext bottomtext

This is a simple Slack webhook used to generate a meme on command via Azure functions. It's very simple, highly focused, and only a proof of concept. The code isn't pretty and the Azure function is not set up for CI/CD because I don't intend to work on it again.
